/**
 *
 * @THINGS_YOU_SHOULD_KEEP_IN_MIND
 *
 *    @SPA_SinglePageApplication
 *      - Single page application means that your app runs on a single html DOM.
 *        But it's capable of showing different views to user.
 *      - By using this kind of approach you can enhacne the UX a lot.
 *
 *    @React_Router
 *      - Router is a special tool which actually watches changes in the URL, and then
 *        changes whats's visible on the screen based on the URL.
 *
 *    @CSS_Files
 *      - In the small project 1 CSS file would be enough to contain styles for all components.
 *      - But this approach is not necessary for a bigger project.
 *      - Therefore you typically need to have a diffrent CSS files for each components.
